<h1>The Best Movies According to Tonia</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Titanic</h3>
 <p>
    I figure life is a gift and I dont intend on wasting it.<br />
    You never know what hand you're going to get dealt next.<br />
    You learn to take life as it comes at you.<br />
</p>
<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>
    Latched in life<br />
    Like branches in a river<br />
    Flowing downstream<br />
    Caught in the current<br />
    I'll carry you<br />
    You'll carry me<br />
    That's how it could be<br />
    Don't you know me?<br />
    Don't you know me by now?<br />
</p>
<h3>Pride & Prejudice</h3>
<p>
    “Miss Elizabeth. 
    I have struggled in vain and can bear it no longer. 
    These past months have been a torment. 
    I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you. 
    I had to see you. 
    I have fought against my better judgment, 
    my family's expectation, the inferiority of your birth, my rank, all these things, 
    and I'm willing to put them aside and ask you to end my agony. 
    I love you. Most ardently. 
    Please do me the honor of accepting my hand.”
