        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Tonia. 
            I am from Beijing, China, and I am currently a first-year master's student in IT program at the University of Auckland. 
            Prior to this, I worked as a editor in publishing industry for several years, driven by my passion for literature. 
            Due to some personal and family reasons, I decided to switch my career to IT, which is a new challenge for me. 
            However, I am determined to put in my best effort. 
            I look forward to learning and growing in this field, and I kindly ask for your guidance and support in my studies. 
            Thank you!</p>
